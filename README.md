# RayMarchingEditor

A real-time ray marching editor to create scenes and animations for my [Rusty Ray Marcher](https://github.com/JeremyFunk/RustRayMarching). 

Render examples:

This editor does not yet support the full capabilities of my [Rusty Ray Marcher](https://github.com/JeremyFunk/RustRayMarching), but I am actively working on it as a side-project, it should have full support in a couple of months.


Signed distance functions and some of the modifiers are translated from the excellent [Inigo Quilez guides](https://iquilezles.org/). Phong Shading is loosely based on the [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect) implementation.
